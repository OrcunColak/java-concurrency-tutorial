//  What Are CPU-bound Operations?
// CPU-bound tasks are those where the speed of execution is limited by the processorâ€™s speed.

// What Are I/O-bound Operations?
// I/O-bound tasks are limited by the speed of input/output operations rather than by the CPU.

// Some tasks might involve a mix of both CPU and I/O-bound operations.
// For instance, a web server handling requests from clients is often both CPU-bound (when processing data) and
// I/O-bound (when reading from or writing to databases).
// Managing such tasks efficiently requires understanding both CPU and I/O limitations.

// Consider a web server that processes user requests, performs calculations, and fetches data from a database.
// This example showcases both CPU-bound (computation) and I/O-bound (simulated database access with Thread.sleep) operations.
// Balancing these two types of operations is key to optimizing such mixed workloads.
